# AdvancedCRA

## Setting things up
- pnpm i to install dependencies
- pnpm build to build dependencies

## Locally testing
Make sure the path of the pkg is correct in ```cliApp/advanced-cra.js```, for now we need to set the path relative to the installing directory

We can install the template locally using this command:
```
npx <path\to\this\directory>
```
OR
```
node <path\to\this\directory>
```
